# Design & Synthesis of Physical Layer of USB-3.0
The USB 3.0 Physical Layer is essential for highspeed data transfer, achieving rates of up to 5 Gbps in the Superspeed architecture. This paper details the design and verification of the Physical Layer using Verilog HDL, focusing on key components such as 8b/10b encoding for balanced data transmission, clock recovery for synchronization, and parallel-to-serial conversion for efficient data handling. The design uses differential signaling for communication and includes power management features to support low-power states. Functional simulation was performed using Modelsim, ensuring compliance with USB 3.0 standards and confirming reliable data transfer with minimal latency. The design was synthesized using the Cadence Genus tool, generating Power, Area, and Timing reports to validate the efficiency of the implementation.
