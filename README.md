# Design & Synthesis of Physical Layer of USB-3.0
The USB 3.0 Physical Layer serves as the backbone of the Superspeed architecture, facilitating robust and high-speed data transfer at a nominal rate of 5 Gbps. This project entails the design and simulation of the USB 3.0 Physical Layer using Verilog HDL, emphasizing critical modules such as 8b/10b encoding for DC-balanced data transmission, clock recovery for bit-level synchronization, and parallel-to-serial conversion for efficient data handling. The layer's architecture leverages unidirectional differential pairs for bidirectional communication and integrates power management features for low-power states. Simulations validate the designâ€™s capacity for asynchronous data transfer with high signal integrity, optimized latency, and adaptability across diverse operating conditions, aligning with the stringent requirements of USB 3.0 standards.
